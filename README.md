# **B√©zier: Crafting Smooth Curves with Intuitive Precision**

## **üèÜ WWDC 2022 Scholarship Project Winner\! üèÜ**

I'm thrilled to share **B√©zier**, my winning project for the Apple WWDC 2022 Swift Student Challenge\! This interactive application was designed to demystify **B√©zier curves**, making their complex mathematics approachable and fun through a highly visual and interactive experience.

## **‚ú® What is B√©zier?**

B√©zier Buddy is more than just a visualization tool; it's a playground for understanding. Built entirely with **SpriteKit**, it allows users to:

* **Manipulate control points:** Directly drag and adjust the anchor and control points of various B√©zier curve types (quadratic, cubic, etc.) in real-time.  
* **Generate Path code:** As you design, B√©zier generates the corresponding Path code, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application in app development.

## **üöÄ Why B√©zier Curves?**

B√©zier curves are fundamental to computer graphics, animation, and user interface design. They are the backbone of:

* **Vector graphics editors:** Think Adobe Illustrator or Sketch.  
* **Font rendering:** Smooth, scalable text on your screen.  
* **Animation paths:** Defining fluid movement in games and apps.  
* **UI/UX design:** Crafting custom shapes, transitions, and delightful user experiences in frameworks like SwiftUI and Core Animation.

My goal with B√©zier was to provide an engaging and intuitive way to grasp these powerful mathematical tools, empowering aspiring developers and designers to leverage them in their own creations.

## **üí° Key Features & Technologies**

* **Interactive Draggable Views:** Custom gestures and view modifiers for seamless manipulation of curve points.  
* **Custom Drawing with Shape and Path:** Extensive use of SwiftUI's drawing primitives to render curves, control points, and the de Casteljau construction lines.  
* **Real-time Code Generation:** A custom parser and formatter to display live SwiftUI Path code that reflects the current curve.  
* **Focus on Clarity & Education:** Every element, from the UI layout to the animations, was designed with the user's understanding in mind.

## **üéØ My WWDC Experience**

Winning the WWDC Scholarship was an incredible honor. It validated my passion for Swift and provided an invaluable opportunity to connect with the global developer community. B√©zier Buddy represents my dedication to learning and my excitement for creating tools that make complex topics accessible.

## **üìö How to Run**

To run B√©zier Buddy, you'll need Xcode 13.0 or later (as it was a WWDC 2022 project).

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/BezierBuddy.git

2. **Open in Xcode:**  
   cd BezierBuddy  
   open BezierBuddy.xcodeproj

3. Run on a simulator or device:  
   Select your desired simulator or a connected iOS device and press Cmd \+ R to build and run the project.

## **üôè Acknowledgments**

A huge thank you to Apple for the WWDC Scholarship program and for providing such incredible tools and resources for developers.
